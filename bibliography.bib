	abstract = {The conventional approach to parametric model fitting of time series is realized through the comparison of various competing models by some ad hoc criterion. Since each of the models is usually specified by the parameters determined by the information from the data, the extension of the classical concept of likelihood to this situation is not obvious. By asking the log likelihood of a model to be an unbiased estimate of the expected log likelihood of the model, a reasonable definition of the likelihood is obtained and this allows us to develop a systematic approach to parametric time series modelling. Practical utility of this approach is demonstrated by numerical examples.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12874-020-01105-9},
	abstract = {Background: Researchers often misinterpret and misrepresent statistical outputs. This abuse has led to a large literature on modification or replacement of testing thresholds and P-values with confidence intervals, Bayes factors, and other devices. Because the core problems appear cognitive rather than statistical, we review some simple methods to aid researchers in interpreting statistical outputs. These methods emphasize logical and information concepts over probability, and thus may be more robust to common misinterpretations than are traditional descriptions.
Methods: We use the Shannon transform of the P-value p, also known as the binary surprisal or S-value s = −log2(p), to provide a measure of the information supplied by the testing procedure, and to help calibrate intuitions against simple physical experiments like coin tossing. We also use tables or graphs of test statistics for alternative hypotheses, and interval estimates for different percentile levels, to thwart fallacies arising from arbitrary dichotomies. Finally, we reinterpret P-values and interval estimates in unconditional terms, which describe compatibility of data with the entire set of analysis assumptions. We illustrate these methods with a reanalysis of data from an existing record-based cohort study.
Conclusions: In line with other recent recommendations, we advise that teaching materials and research reports discuss P-values as measures of compatibility rather than significance, compute P-values for alternative hypotheses whenever they are computed for null hypotheses, and interpret interval estimates as showing values of high compatibility with data, rather than regions of confidence. Our recommendations emphasize cognitive devices for displaying the compatibility of the observed data with various hypotheses of interest, rather than focusing on single hypothesis tests or interval estimates. We believe these simple reforms are well worth the minor effort they require.},
